SYNDICATE SAVANTS - TWINSCAPE OIL WELL MONITOR 

Welcome to the official repository of the Digital Twin Oil Well Monitoring System, developed by Team SYNDICATE SAVANTS.
This project provides a cutting-edge solution for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance of oil wells, using the concept of digital twins.

Project Overview
The Digital Twin Oil Well Monitoring System is designed to offer a digital representation of a physical oil well system. It enables real-time monitoring of operational parameters such as temperature, pressure, water flow, and equipment status. This system provides valuable insights into the oil wellâ€™s health, allowing for predictive maintenance and minimizing downtime. The system incorporates advanced data analytics, IoT integration, and 3D visualization.

  Features:
    Real-Time Data Monitoring: Live tracking of oil well parameters.
    Predictive Maintenance: Algorithms predict equipment failures and notify operators before they occur.
    Digital Twin Environment: A 3D digital twin of the oil well enables operators to visualize real-time data in a virtual environment.
    MQTT Integration: Efficient data collection from IoT devices.
    User-Friendly Interface: A smooth and interactive UI for monitoring and decision-making.

Technology Stack:
  Unity Engine: Used for creating the 3D visualization of the oil well.
  MQTT Protocol: For real-time data transmission.
  Python: Backend for data analytics and machine learning models.
  Blender: For 3D modeling of oil well components.
  Oculus Meta Quest 2 (Optional): For immersive VR experience.
  Embedded Systems and IoT Sensors: Collect data from physical assets.
  Getting Started

Prerequisites:
  Unity 2022.4.0f or above
  Python 3.x
  MQTT broker setup(suggested mqttx to explore)
  VR headset (optional)

Installation:
  Clone this repository:
    bash
      Copy code
        git clone : https://github.com/Sanjay67789/digitaltwin_oil_well_monitor/tree/main
 
  Navigate to the project directory:
    bash
      Copy code
        cd digitaltwin_oil_well_monitor

Open the project in Unity and configure the MQTT settings.
Set up the backend server for data analysis (Python and necessary libraries).
Run the project in Unity to visualize real-time data in the digital twin.
